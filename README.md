## Overview

The main goal of this project was to learn some basics of React and React Router. Additionally, I tried Tailwind CSS, which helped me accomplish responsive design of the webpage quite easily.

### The challenge

The default requirements for the challenge:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

My goals:

- Create dynamic contents without need to toggle componenets visibility using only CSS
- Ensure proper page routing
